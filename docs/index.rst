=================================

`Visit MABE2 on github here <https://github.com/mercere99/MABE2>`_.

MABE is a software framework deigned to easily build and customize software for evolutionary computation or artificial life. 
The resulting systems should be useful for studying evolutionary dynamics, solving complex problems, comparing evolving systems, or exploring the open-ended power of evolution.

MABE version 2.0 is being re-built from scratch, using the Empirical library. 
Our goal is to allow for more modular control, flexible agents, faster run times and portability to the web.
